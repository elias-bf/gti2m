git ls-files 

git-ls-files - Show information about files in the index and the working tree

descrição

This merges the file listing in the directory cache index with the actual 
working directory list, and shows different combinations of the two.

One or more of the options below may be used to determine the files shown:



git status

git-status - Show the working tree status

Descrição

Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current 
HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index 
file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git (and are not 
ignored by gitignore[5]). The first are what you would commit by running git 
commit; the second and third are what you could commit by running git add 
before running git commit.
